the tamagotchi app is an app that was designed in te 90s which is quite a while back. the app was designed to cure boredom back then. it is one of the oldest games till this day. How i ceated this app was through android studio. i had to use 2 activities because there had to be 2 screens. on the first activity, you will see a layout . on the layout/design, it is a welcome message and a picture of the dog. at the very bottom, you will find a button which you have to clcik in order to continue
